# Hello there.
Hey there I am *eaxly*.
I like (n)vim, linux, code and kurzgesagt videos (they are the best).

I use linux (arch btw) on my laptop.

I like a lot of stuff. I have recently (re)discovered [chess](https://lichess.org/@/eaxly), and think it's pretty cool even if I'm not very good at it.


The online handle has a pretty weird but rather short history:  
- XX`randomstuff`noobXX
- `stuff+randomdigits`
- ExtinctAxolotl
- *e*xtinct*ax*olotl â†’ *eax*
and since *eax* is too short or taken by most services online, *eaxly*.

<!-- TODO: add some stuff about me, myself and I -->
